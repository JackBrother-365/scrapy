"1","good 4 u","https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Olivia-Rodrigo/good-4-u","(Ah)

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easilyYou found a new girl and it only took a couple weeks
Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world? (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand new girl

Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want (ah)
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off (ah)
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? (Ha)
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you?
Well, screw that and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do

Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all

Well, good for you, you look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
Good for you, you're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you

Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily"
"2","Todo De Ti","https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Rauw-Alejandro/Todo-De-Ti","One, two
One, two, threeEl viento soba tu cabello
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Me matan esos ojos bellos
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Me gusta tu olor
De tu piel, el color

Y como me haces sentir
Me gusta tu boquita
Ese labial rosita
Y cómo me besas a mí

Contigo quiero despertar
Hacerlo después de fumar
Ya no tengo na' que buscar
Algo fuera de aquí

Tú combinas con el mar
Ese bikini se ve fenomenal
No hay gravedad que me pueda elevar
Me pones mal a mí

Aceleraste mis latidos
Es que me gusta todo de ti
De to'as tus partes, ¿cuál decido?
Es que me gusta todo de ti
Es que me gusta todo de ti
Es que me gusta todo de ti

Quinta Avenida, no va pa'l mall
Ella sabe que le llego a todo en un call
En la Raptor me gusta ponerla en Ford
El jogger large, la camisa small

Como la dieta keto
Por ti me controlo y me quedo quieto
Aunque quiero comerte to' eso completo
De ese culo me volví un te'co, eh

Micro dosis, rola, oxy
Besando esos labios glossy
Ya yo le di en to'as las posi'

Shampoo de coco
Chanel su wallet
Me vuelve loco desde el casco
Hasta los pedales

Contigo quiero despertar
Hacerlo después de fumar
Ya no tengo na' que buscar
Algo fuera de aquí

Tú combinas con el mar
Ese bikini se ve fenomenal
No hay gravedad que me pueda elevar
Me pones mal a mí

Aceleraste mis latidos
Es que me gusta todo de ti
De to'as tus partes, ¿cuál decido?
Es que me gusta todo de ti
Todo de ti, todo de ti
Es que me gusta todo de ti
Todo de ti, todo de ti
Es que me gusta todo de ti

Contigo quiero despertar
Hacerlo después de fumar
Ya no tengo na' que buscar
Algo fuera de aquí

Tú combinas con el mar
Ese bikini se ve fenomenal
No hay gravedad que me pueda elevar
Me pones mal a mí

Rauw Alejandro
Algo fuera de mí
Me pones mal a mí"

"4","deja vu","https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Olivia-Rodrigo/deja-vu","Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jacketsLaughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hm

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah), hmm
Do you get déjà vu? Huh

Do you call her, almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type

I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (ooh)

So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

I know you get déjà vu

I know you get déjà vu

I know you get déjà vu"

A sign of the times every time that I speak
A dime and a nine, it was mine every week

I like to say, ""What if?""
But if we could kiss and just cut the rubbish
Then I might be on to something
I ain't giving you one in public
I'm giving you hundreds, fuck it

Something we just gotta get into
Sign first, middle, last, on the wisdom tooth
Niggas wishing that the pussy was a kissing booth
Taste breakfast, lunch, and gin, and juice
And that dinner just like dessert too
And when we French, refresh, gimme two
When I bite that lip, come get me too
He want lipstick, lip-gloss, hickeys too, huh

Push your limit, no, you ain't good enough
All your niggas say that you lost without me
All my bitches feel like I dodged the county
Fucking with you feel like jail, nigga
I can't even exhale, nigga
Pussy like holy grail, you know that
You gon' make me need bail, you know that
Caught dipping with your friend
You ain't even half man, lying on your-, you know that
Got me a bag full of brick, you know that
Control, don't slow the pace if I throw back
All this ass for real (all this ass)
Drama make you feel (make you feel)
Fantasy and whip appeal is all I can give you

We're so young, boy, we ain't got nothing to lose, uh-oh

Ah, ah, ah, ahBrown guilty eyes and little white lies, yeah
I played dumb but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you

And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry for the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly

Ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?

You betrayed me
And I know that you'll never feel sorry for the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor

(Ah-ah-ah) God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
(Ah-ah-ah) When she's sleepin' in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way

You betrayed me
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry for the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
You gave me your word, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat
But you're still, you're still a traitor (ah-ah-ah)
Yeah, you're still a traitor

(Ooh-ooh-ooh) God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you"
"9","drivers license","https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Olivia-Rodrigo/drivers-license","I got my driver′s license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for meTo finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying ′cause you weren't around

And you're probably with that blonde girl
Who always made me doubt
She′s so much older than me
She′s everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
′Cause how could I ever love someone else?

And I know we weren't perfect
But I′ve never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I′m gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
′Cause they′ll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you

And I know we weren't perfect
But I′ve never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I′m gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
′Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fucking love you, babe (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Sidewalks we crossed
I still hear your voice in the traffic
We′re laughing over all the noise
God, I′m so blue, know we're through
But I still fucking love you, babe (ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)

I know we weren′t perfect
But I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can′t imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone

"11","favorite crime","https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Olivia-Rodrigo/favorite-crime","Know that I loved you so bad
I let you treat me like that
I was your willing accomplice, honeyAnd I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody

The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wondеr if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you minе
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was goin' down, but I was doin' it with you
Yeah, everything we broke and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
Oh, look what we became

Oh, the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
Oh, the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

Your favorite crime, your favorite crime

I'm so insecure, I thinkThat I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I, if not exploited?

And I'm so sick of 17
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
""Enjoy your youth,"" I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more

All I did was try my best
This the kind of thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (ah, ah, ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
(Yeah!)

I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park

All I did was try my best
This the kind of thanks I get?
Unrelentlessly upset (ah, ah, ah)
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
(Yeah! Just having a really good time)

Got a broken ego, broken heart
(It's brutal out here, it's brutal out here)
And God, I don't even know where to start"

Nah-nah, yeah

A single teardrop falling from your eye

I'll make you cry when I run away (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Save your tears for another day (mm)

Met you once under a Pisces moon

Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell

I don't know why I run away (run away, oh, oh, oh, oh)

And you deserve someone better

Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

I don't know why I run away (bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I'll make you cry when I run away (save)

Save your tears for another day (ooh)
Ooh, girl (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, okay)
I said save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Save your tears for another day (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Save your tears for another day"

Your friends aren't mine, you know, I know
You've moved on, found someone newOne more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was attached
For all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?

Oh, I hope you're happy, but not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed you meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind, she probably gives you butterflies

I hope you're happy, but not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

I hope you're happy, just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
So find someone great, don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier"

I'm like, ""Yeah, that's true"" (that's true)

Don't believe in T-H-O-T
She keep playing me dumb (play me)

Y'all don't really know my mental
Lemme give you the picture like stencil

Falling out, in a drought
No flow, rain wasn't pouring down (pouring down)
See, that pain was all around
See, my mode was kinda lounged
Didn't know which-which way to turn
Flow was cool but I still felt burnt
Energy up, you can feel my surge
I'ma kill everything like this purge (ayy)

Let's just get this straight for a second, I'ma work
Even if I don't get paid for progression, I'ma get it (get it)
Everything that I do is electric
I'ma keep it in a motion
Keep it moving like kinetic, ayy (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Put this shit in a frame, better know I don't blame
Everything that I say, man I seen you deflate
Let me elevate, this ain't a prank
Have you walkin' on a plank, li-li-li-li-like
Both hands together, God, let me pray (now let me pray)
Uh, I've been going right, right around, call that relay (Masked Wolf)

Pass the baton, back and I'm on
Swimming in the pool, Kendrick Lamar, uh
Want a piece of this, a piece of mine, my peace a sign
Can you please read between the lines?
My rhyme's inclined to break your spine
They say that I'm so fine
You could never match my grind
Please do not, not waste my time

What you know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that mental freeze
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion, yeah

Voi siete sporchi, fra', di fango
Giallo di siga fra le ditaIo con la siga camminando
Scusami, ma ci credo tanto
Che posso fare questo salto
E anche se la strada è in salita
Per questo ora mi sto allenando

E buonasera, signore e signori, fuori gli attori
Vi conviene toccarvi i coglioni
Vi conviene stare zitti e buoni
Qui la gente è strana, tipo spacciatori
Troppe notti stavo chiuso fuori
Mo' li prendo a calci 'sti portoni
Sguardo in alto tipo scalatori
Quindi scusa mamma se sto sempre fuori, ma

Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro

Io ho scritto pagine e pagine, ho visto sale poi lacrime
Questi uomini in macchina e non scalare le rapide
C'è scritto sopra una lapide, in casa mia non c'è Dio
Ma se trovi il senso del tempo risalirai dal tuo oblio
E non c'è vento che fermi la naturale potenza
Dal punto giusto di vista, del vento senti l'ebrezza
Con ali in cera alla schiena ricercherò quell'altezza
Se vuoi fermarmi ritenta, prova a tagliarmi la testa perché

Sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro

Parla, la gente purtroppo parla
Non sa di che cosa parla
Tu portami dove sto a galla
Che qui mi manca l'aria
Parla, la gente purtroppo parla
Non sa di che cosa parla
Tu portami dove sto a galla
Che qui mi manca l'aria
Parla, la gente purtroppo parla
Non sa di che cazzo parla
Tu portami dove sto a galla
Che qui mi manca l'aria

Ma sono fuori di testa, ma diverso da loro
E tu sei fuori di testa, ma diversa da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro
Siamo fuori di testa, ma diversi da loro

Noi siamo diversi da loro"

Mmm-mmm (Yatra, Yatra)Qué tan loco sería
Si yo fuera el dueño de tu corazón por solo un día
Si nos gana la alegría, yo por fin te besaría
¿Qué pasaría?
Podría ser entre él y yo, ¿quién ganaría?

Mi condición; enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño
Y el no tenerte me hace daño
Seríamo' la pareja del año
Cuánto te extraño
Sin condición
Me enamoré, precisamente, de una chica que no es mía
Y mis amigos lo sabían
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías

Si me dieran solo 24 hora', yo la' aprovecho
Jura'o que yo voy a hacerte cosa' que nunca te han hecho
Ya yo me cansé de ser amigo' con derecho'
Yo tal ve' no te merezco, pero no hay ni que decirlo

Si no' juntamo' seríamo' la pareja del siglo
Con ella acapella me da con introducirlo
Navaja doble filo
Cortamo' y lo' video' me dio con reproducirlo'

Me lo decían, yo los ignoraba
Simplemente, todo ahora quedó en la nada
Se lo hacía y a los ojo' la miraba
Yo nunca creía que el amor cegaba

Y no tenerte me hace daño
Seríamo' la pareja del año
Cuánto te extraño
Sin condición
Me enamoré, precisamente, de una chica que no es mía
Y mis amigos lo sabían
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías

Asumí mi depresión de ver una foto tuya
Y verte en la televisión puede ser que me destruya la mente
Detente, como dice la canción
Que no meten preso a nadie por robarse un corazón

Sufriendo, llorando de pena
Que no vea mi llanto, no vale la pena
Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas
Te vuelves la mala de nuestra novela

Me tienes sufriendo, llorando de pena
Que no vea mi llanto no vale la pena
Yo no tengo alas, pero tú sí vuelas
Me quitas la pista y me quedo acapella

Mi condición; enamorado locamente de una chica que hoy extraño
Y el no tenerte me hace daño
Seríamo' la pareja del año
Cuánto te extraño
Sin condición
Me enamoré, precisamente, de una chica que no es mía
Y mis amigos lo sabían
Y a mí todo el mundo me decía que pasaría, me dejarías

Yo tenía otra melodía
De lo que resultaría
Maldita monotonía
¿Fue culpa tuya o fue culpa mía? (seríamo' la pareja del año)
Yo aprendí a vivir con celos (con celos)
Tú aprendiste a no ser mía (no-oh)
Solo queda ser sincero
Yo te quiero todavía"
"20","enough for you","https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Olivia-Rodrigo/enough-for-you","I wore makeup when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queensI know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
And all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back

Before you found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough

Don't you think I loved you too much to be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much to think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday I'll be everything to somebody else
And they'll think that I am so exciting
And you'll be the one who's crying

Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough
For you, enough for you, oh-oh
No, nothing's enough for you"

I'm lowkey spinnin' out

I'm countin' down 'til Friday come
I'm gonna, I'ma gonna do too much

Their lives again
Their lives, to pull us
Their lives again

This can't be bad for me 'cause I want more
Wanna feel the bass vibrating through the floor
So keep it playing, I'm on a wave
And I'ma ride it all the way
When it comes like

We want that weekend (again, -gain, again, -gain, -gain)

Just to ask you how you are
All I did was speak normallySomehow, I still struck a nerve
You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kind of stuff

'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

And maybe, in some masochistic way
I kinda find it all excitin'
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?

It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand

No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead

It's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the roller-coaster's all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand"

I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

And I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights

I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching bandHis parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad

And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush
Don't know if I'll see you again someday
But if you're out there
I hope that you're okay

My middle school friend grew up alone
She raised her brothers on her own
Her parents hated who she loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood

Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you
And I hope that you're okay

Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing's as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred
But, God, I hope that you're happier today
'Cause I love you
And I hope that you're okay"

If you wanted, you can take a private plane
A kilómetros estamos conectando
Y me prendes aunque no me estés tocando

You can't fight it, you can't breathe

You know it hurts me too
You look so broken when you cry

I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high

Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high

I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high

Tastes like strawberries
On a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want your belly
And that summer feelin'
I don't know if I could ever go without

Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high (sugar)
Watermelon sugar high (sugar)
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar high

I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it
Watermelon sugar high
Watermelon sugar"
"40","Beautiful Mistakes (feat. Megan Thee Stallion)","https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Maroon-5-Megan-Thee-Stallion/Beautiful-Mistakes-Megan-Thee-Stallion","It's beautiful, it's bittersweet
You're like a broken home to me
I take a shot of memoriesAnd black out like an empty street
I fill my days with the way you walk
And fill my nights with broken dreams
I make up lies inside my head
Like one day you'll come back to me

Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, ayy
Makin' beautiful mistakes

It's pitiful, I can't believe
How every day gets worse for me
I take a break, I cut you off
To keep myself from lookin' soft
I fill my nights with the way you was
And still wake up with broken dreams
I make these lies inside my head
Feel like they're my reality

Now I'm not holding on, not holding on
I'm just depressed that you're gone
Not holding on, not holding on

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

You did me wrong 'cause I let you (let you)

Usually, I like my situations beneficial
Doin' something different, got me lookin' stupid (damn)
The only way I'm comin' back to you is if you're dreaming, lucid

Prove it, if you made a promise then keep it (keep it)
Why you wanna lie and then get mad? I don't believe it (boy, bye)
But really, I was doin' just fine without ya
Lookin' fine, sippin' wine, dancin' on club couches (ah)

Baby, why you wanna lose me like you don't need me? (Don't need me)
Like I don't block you and you still try to reach me (still try to reach me)
How you figure out how to call me from the TV? (Huh?)
You're runnin' outta chances and this time I mean it (ah)

Yeah, bet you miss my love, all in your bed
Now you're stressin' out, pulling your hair
Smelling your pillows and wishin' I was there
Slidin' down the shower wall, lookin' sad
I know it's hard to let go, I'm the best
Best you ever had and best you gon' get
And if we break up, I don't wanna be friends, you're toxic

Beautiful mistakes
I make inside my head, she's naked in my bed
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes
I wouldn't take 'em back, I'm in love with the past
And now we lie awake, makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, yeah, yeah (oh)
Makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah, in my head
Nah-nah-nah, in my bed
Nah-nah-nah, ayy
Makin' beautiful mistakes

Nah-nah-nah
Nah-nah-nah (ooh)
Nah-nah-nah"
