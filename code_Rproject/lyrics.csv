With all the news that is news
Across the nationOn the scene at the supermarket
There seems to have been some disturbance here
Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?

Yeah, I did
I's standin' over there by the tomaters
And here he come
Running through the pole beans
Through the fruits and vegetables
Nekkid as a jay bird
And I hollered over t' Ethel
I said, ""Don't look, Ethel!""
But it's too late
She'd already been incensed.

(Here he comes)
Boogity, boogity
(There he goes)
Boogity, boogity
(And he ain't wearin' no clothes)

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(Boogity, boogity)
Fastest thing on two feet
(Boogity, boogity)
He's just as proud as he can be
Of his anatomy
He goin' give us a peek

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
(Boogity, boogity)
He likes to show off his physique
(Boogity, boogity)
If there's an audience to be found
He'll be streakin' around
Invitin' public critique

This is your action news reporter once again
And we're here at the gas station
Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?

Yeah, I did
I's just in here gettin my tires checked
An' he just appeared out of the traffic
He come streakin' around the grease rack there
Didn't have nothin' on but a smile
I looked in there, and Ethel was gettin' her a cold drink
I hollered, ""Don't look, Ethel!""
But it was too late
She'd already been mooned
Flashed her right there in front of the shock absorbers

(He ain't crude)
Boogity, boogity
(He ain't lewd)
Boogity, boogity
(He's just in the mood to run in the nude)

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak

He likes to turn the other cheek
(Boogity, boogity)
He's always makin' the news
Wearin' just his tennis shoes
Guess you could call him unique

Once again, your action news reporter
In the booth at the gym
Covering the disturbance at the basketball playoff
Pardon me, sir, did you see what happened?

Yeah, I did
Half time, I's just goin' down thar to get Ethel a snow cone
And here he come, right out of the cheap seats, dribbling
Right down the middle of the court
Didn't have on nothing but his PF's.
Made a hook shot and got out through the concessions stands
I hollered up at Ethel
I said, ""Don't look, Ethel!""
But it was too late.
She'd already got a free shot
Grandstandin', right there in front of the home team

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak
Here he comes again.

Who's that with him?
The fastest thing on two feet
Ethel? Is that you, Ethel?

You git your clothes on!
Of his anatomy
He's gonna give us a peek

Oh, yes, they call him the Streak

You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again

Came when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin

This song is for you, filled with gratitude and love
God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God bless me with you
You make me feel brand new

I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new

Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and made me sure

You gave my pride back to me
Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend
You're someone who I can depend

To walk a path that sometimes bends
Without you
Life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me

For God bless me with you

(Just like you do)
Don't kid yourselfInto thinking that she don't

She can fool around
(Just like you do)
Unless you give her
All the loving she wants

Don't make the mistake
Of thinking old fashioned
Times have changed
From yesterday

No longer will
Those old double standards
Be accepted
By the women of today

So, when you think you've fooled her
She just might be fooling you
Remember: if you can do it
She can, too

Because a woman needs love
(Just like you do)
Hey, don't kid yourself
Into thinking that she don't

She can fool around
(Just like you do)
Unless you give her
All the loving she wants

When her eyes
Are begging for affection
Don't put her off
Don't make her wait

Don't try to give her
That worn out excuse
About being tired
And working late

I tell ya:
One day you'll come home
Early from work
(Home from work)
Open up the door
And get your feelings hurt

Because she needs it
Yeah
(Just like you do)
A woman's got to have it
Yeah
Just like you

And if you're smart
(Just like you do)
You better stop fooling around
'Cause she will, too

(Just like you do)

Had been loving Jill

(Just like you do)
Hey, don't kid yourself
Into thinking that she don't

She can fool around
(Yeah)
She will fool around, so
(Just like you do)
You better take out some insurance
And be sure she won't

Give her that love
(Just like you do)
Yeah
That sweet, sweet love
She wants it
Just like you

'Cause she can fool around
(Just like you do)
I tell ya:
She will fool around
With you or without you
Just like you do

A woman needs love
(Just like you do)
Hey, don't kid yourself

Come in and I landed
Nelly Furtado
Come in and I landed

She's a freak and
I'm a chief head banger with
The top down low on the flow
'Cause you're so fresh (fresh) like
B-boys with vests like runners'
Carved chests?
He he he he
I run like the breeze to
Catch this life but sometimes
Get a need till I bleed
There's truth, I go
There's around, I will tell it
A story, on the planet
Missy come in and I landed
Well where did she come from?
This international Goddess sun
So get your hands up
Like this hun
Until the party's just begun
So come over to my house
And that's where
This song's from a less
For the laugh from
West coast version
Portugese diva
And Missy's the woman
Who always be cooking
Says somethin' for Neltado
Who come dip her vibin'
From DC to DJ and
All around the world
Come giddy up
Giddy up back back
Up to my girl

Un get ur freak on (repeat)
Get (Scatted)
Get your freak on

Who's that bitch?
Me me Nelly Nelly
Nelly Furtado
All in your stereo
I'm pumpin' louder
Please don't tell me
You don't like the flow
You got the means
To put down
So lemme step it
Yo

It's a original flow
People better lay low
Stick you up like velcro
'Cause me and Nelly say so
I'm doin' how we do
Some strange loose thing
You crew
Because my fire springs
Your head round right

Cursing at your life
You're a discontented motherAnd a regimented wife
I 've no doubt
You dream about the things you'll never do
But I wish someone had a talk to me like I wanna talk to you

Ooh, I've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free

I've been to paradise but I've never been to me...

Please lady please lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes

Won't you share a part
Of a weary heart that has lived a million lives

Ooh, I've been to Nice and the Isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
And showed them what I've got

I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things that a woman ain't s'posed to see
I've been to paradise but I've never been to me...

Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
A fantasy we created about people and places
As we like them to be
But you know what truth is?

It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you are gonna make love to tonight
That's truth that's love

Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life
I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet

I spent my life exploring
The subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free
Hey lady I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me...

I've been to paradise - never been to me
(I've been to Georgia and California, and anywhere I could run)
I've been to paradise - never been to me
(I've been to Nice and the isle of Greece
While I sipped champagne on a yacht)

While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clearAll those years ago

I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
All you need is love

Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all

We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago

All those years ago

All those years ago

Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of lies
And all else that we despised

They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago

You said it all though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago

Before you found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough

Don't you think I loved you too much to be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much to think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday I'll be everything to somebody else
And they'll think that I am so exciting
And you'll be the one who's crying

Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough
For you, enough for you, oh-oh
No, nothing's enough for you"
"15","I have a tale to tell
Sometimes it gets so hard to hide it well
I was not ready for the fallToo blind to see the writing on the wall

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me

I know where beauty lives
I've seen it once
I know the warmth she gives
The light that you could never see
It shines inside you can't take that from me...

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me...

The truth is never far behind
You've kept it hidden well
If I live to tell the secret I knew then
Will I ever have the chance again?

If I ran away
I'd never have the strength to go very far
How would they hear the beating of my heart...?
Will it grow cold?
(Will it grow cold?)
The secret that I hide
Will I grow old?
How will they hear?
When will they learn?
How will they know...?

A man can tell a thousand lies
I've learned my lesson well
Hope I live to tell the secret I have learned till then it will burn inside of me...

Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess insideGive them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

Everybody searching for a hero
People need someone to look up to
I never found anyone who fulfill my needs
A lonely place to be
And so I learned to depend on me

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me
The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
It is the greatest love of all

I believe the children are our future
Teach them well and let them lead the way
Show them all the beauty they possess inside
Give them a sense of pride to make it easier
Let the children's laughter remind us how we used to be

I decided long ago
Never to walk in anyone's shadows
If I fail, if I succeed
At least I'll live as I believe
No matter what they take from me
They can't take away my dignity

Because the greatest love of all
Is happening to me
I found the greatest love of all
Inside of me

The greatest love of all
Is easy to achieve
Learning to love yourself
Is the greatest love of all

And if, by chance, that special place
That you've been dreaming of
Leads you to a lonely place
Find your strength in love","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Yeah alright

And when I pull out my jammy, get ready 'cause it might go

You to get wit' Mr. Smith don't riff
Listen to my gear shift

The party is here on the Westside
So I reach for my 40 and I turn it up
Designated driver take the keys to my truck
Hit the shore 'cause I'm faded
Honeys in the street say, ""Monty, yo we made it!""
It feels so good, in my hood, tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gang bangers forgot about the drive by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna be player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lowercase G
But now I'm a big G, the girls see I got the money
A hundred dollar bills y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64

He works from nine to five and then
He takes another home again

Only when he gives me, makes me feel alright

We want the funk
We want the funk
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro...)

""Excuse me, where have I seen you?""
They tend to ask me
A humble answer I give them
As we start to get closer
But then even more so
They all persist on rubbing my torso

I am Latin, but I ain't wrapping in satin, no!
That old disco look, just ain't happening
I'm fresh and new and making my debut
So, let me run this information by you

It's true, we outdo, it has become an issue
Love 'em and leave 'em fast, we won't miss you
It's our tradition, we're well conditioned
We outlast the competition
So, listen!

We don't care too much about kissing, no!
We know just what you've been missing, hon!
We're straight out and blunt
We don't put up with stunts...
Baby, you know what we want...

We want the funk
Give up the funk (pow!)
We need the funk
Gotta have that funk (pow!)

We want the funk
Give up the funk (pow!)
We need the funk
Gotta have that funk (pow!)

Don't play shy, don't expect long good-byes
These are some of the rules that we go by
No demands and forget holding hands
Please, not around our friends

We intend to hold on to our image
Don't try to cross the line of scrimmage
Don't say you weren't aware
So, have yourself prepared and beware
This is a one-time love affair

See, ""that's as far as it goes"" is our motto
And you thought you won the lotto
Waiting to claim your prize
You go unrecognized
Huh! How's that for a surprise?

So, save yourself from confusion and sorrow
Don't even think about tomorrow
Tonight's the night, enjoy!
We're here to make some noise
Let me hear the high pitch in your voice...

We want the funk
Give up the funk (pow!)
We need the funk
Gotta have that funk (pow!)

We want the funk
Give up the funk (pow!)
We need the funk
Gotta have that funk (pow!)

Da, da, da, da... (Ooh, ooh... oooh...) pow!

Smoother than James Bond
You wake and we're gone
So, you wonder what you did wrong, huh?
Don't be blamin' yourself
It's a must that we vanish
Here's the scoop straight to you but in Spanish...

Oye nena, rubia, morena
Mi excusa está en mis venas
Soy un simple mujeriego, no lo niego ni miento
Soy latino cien por ciento

Así que piénsalo bien
¿Si no es conmigo, con quién es?
Responde de una vez...
No te me hagas la importante, la difícil o atorrante
Al cabo tengo más amantes

No te prometo nada, saldrás por donde entrastes
Yo no pienso molestarte
Así que no me busques, me sigas, me asustes
Busca a otro que te ajuste

Now there it is, laid out plain and simple
In Spanish, but on tempo
Can't comprehend at all, confused or in a hole?
Yo! What's the matter? ¿No habla español?

If that's the case, then, no need to worry
Bust out the dictionary
You want some inside info?
Wanna know what you're in for?
Look up right under ""nympho"" ...

We want the funk (got you babe)
Give up the funk (pow!)
We need the funk (got you babe)
Gotta have that funk (pow!)

We want the funk (got to have you)

Gotta have that funk (pow!)

Give up the funk (pow!)
We need the funk (babe, need it baby)
Gotta have that funk (pow!)

We want the funk (I need it baby)
Give up the funk (pow!)

But that was many years ago
And by the time i came along
Things were already going wrong
I felt the pain in their pretence
The side they tried hard not to show
But through the simple eyeys of youth
It wasn't hard to see the truth

And in the end nobody wins
When loves begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins
The game nobody wins

They must have loved each other once
Before the magic slipped away
And as their life became a lie
What love remained began to die
I used to hide beneath the sheets
I prayed that time would find a way
But with the passing of the years
I watched as laughter turned to tears

And in the end nobody wins...

We used to love each other once
With all the passion we posessed
But people change as time goes by
Some feelings grow while others die
But if we can learn from what we'll see
And face the truth while we still can
Then, though the passion may be gone
Some kind of love can still live on","","","","","","","","","","Put on my blue suede shoes

Touched down in the land of the Delta BluesIn the middle of the pouring rain

But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
Was walking with my feet, ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing, waiting for the king
Down in the Jungle Room

When I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet, ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
Boy, you got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel, plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
To do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said, ""Tell me are you a Christian child?""
And I said, ""Ma'am, I am tonight""

Like ice cream melting they embracedYears of bad decisions runnin' down her face

I wanted to tell him it would be ok

I'm 10 years old, and he's holding my hand
We're talkin' on the front porch watchin' the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around
So many things I wanna say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind

But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry

I'm sittin' here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the lord
Got so much to be thankful for

I haven't had my story yet.

When I needed a hand
And it couldn't be foundI was so far down
That I couldn't get up
You know and
One day I was one of life's losers
Even my friends were my accusers
And in my head
I'd lost before I'd begun

I had a dream
But it turned to dust
And what I thought was love
That must have been lust
I was living in style
When the walls fell in
When I played my hand
I looked like a joker
Turned around
Fate must have woke her
'Cause lady luck
She was waiting outside the door

I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
I'm winning
And I don't intend on losing again

Too bad it belonged to me
It was the wrong time
And not meant to be
Took a long time
And I knew for now
I can see the day
That I breathe for
Friends agree, there's a need
To play the game
And to win again

Following the stars
Don't need no book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all

She has a train goin' downtown
She's got a club on the moon
But she's tellin' all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon
She's the heart of the fun fair
She's got me whistlin' her private tune

And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend

She says, ""Hello, you fool, I love you""

A towhead blond with eyes of salt
He played the drum in the marching bandHis parents cared more about the Bible
Than being good to their own child
He wore long sleeves 'cause of his dad

And somehow, we fell out of touch
Hope he took his bad deal and made a royal flush

But if you're out there
I hope that you're okay

She raised her brothers on her own
Her parents hated who she loved
She couldn't wait to go to college
She was tired 'cause she was brought into a world
Where family was merely blood

Does she know how proud I am she was created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred?
We don't talk much, but I just gotta say
I miss you
And I hope that you're okay

Address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings
Nothing's forever, nothing's as good as it seems
And when the clouds won't iron out
And the monsters creep into your house
And every door is hard to close

Well, I hope you know how proud I am you were created
With the courage to unlearn all of their hatred

Could you be a little weak?

Do you know

What it feels like in this world
For a girl?

Hair that twirls on finger tips
So gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips
Repenting

Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less...?

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you goI didn't know nothing I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself

I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Or what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here
'Cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's going to talk to me on
The phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's going to take your place?
There ain't nobody better

I can't sleep at night, when you're on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute this is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station

So I turn the dial trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things crying trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
Pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you need you back in my life baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please

Stay until the light of day
Keep your smiling alive

Lay your heart next to mine
You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here
You don't have to go home

There's a cool breeze blowing in the curtains way
I kiss your lips and you touch my face

Is this real or am I dreaming?
I wonder what you're thinkin
I can't tell
If it's about tomorrow it'll fix itself
'Cause I don't wanna lose this feeling
When I look in your eyes I hear myself saying

You don't have to go home tonight
Stay until the light of day
Keep your smiling alive

Lay your heart next to mine
You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here
You don't have to go home

There's no hurry, I only want this moment
Want this moment to last
If you believe in love the same way I do
Maybe this is a chance
You don't have to go

You don't have to go home tonight
So hard to go our separate ways
So better stay right here
You don't have to go home tonight

You don't have to go home tonight
Stay until the light of day
You don't have to go home tonight (Come over my head)
I'm in too deep
The hours getting late and it's time to leave
You don't have to go home tonight (There's a cool breathe blowing)
In the curtains way, I kiss your lips and you touch my face
You don't have to go home tonight (Come over my head)

From a lonely cold hotel room

Of the kids laughing in the background

A little voice came on the phone
Said ""Daddy when you coming home""
He said the first thing that came to his mind

I'm already there
Take a look around
I'm the sunshine in your hair
I'm the shadow on the ground
I'm the whisper in the wind
I'm your imaginary friend
And I know I'm in your prayers
Oh I'm already there

She got back on the phone
Said I really miss you darling
Don't worry about the kids they'll be alright
Wish I was in your arms
Lying right there beside you
But I know that I'll be in your dreams tonight
And I'll gently kiss your lips
Touch you with my fingertips
So turn out the light and close your eyes

I'm already there
Don't make a sound
I'm the beat in your heart
I'm the moonlight shining down
I'm the whisper in the wind

On my birthday, you sang me a Heart of Gold
With a guitar humming and no clothes

Into the air
Left me in pieces

Finding my wings

As close as the beat of my heart

People passing me by
They look me up and down
But they don't look me in the eye
I'm just another stranger
In my own home town
Looking for an angel
But heaven can't be found
I say, hey, are you lonely tonight
Hey, hey, hey I'm gonna make it through
But that don't make it right

Does anybody really give their heart to somebody?
Does anybody really ever open that door?

And I'm sad to say it's me

The sunday evenings, the fun we used to share
Looking through the memories in my mind
Since i've laughed and cried and thought it over
Now i realize that it's never over only set aside

I will never be free from your embrace
Sweet baby
Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you sweet baby
Ever always been captured by your smile, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your side
Right by your side
Lying here alone I'm dreaming
My mind keeps wonderin'
My thoughts are only you
Wanderin' through the mem'ries in my mind
How could love so real have gone so empty?
My mind keeps wonderin' why
Will i ever find the love we shared
Together you and i?
Oh it's you sweet baby
Though we've had such a long hard road to climb, sweet baby
Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you, sweet baby
Won't you try and believe in what i say, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your side, right by your side
Oh its you sweet baby
I will never be free from your embrace

All the denouncement, had absolutely no effect
Parents and counselors, constantly scorn themBut people are still having sex and nothing seems to stop them.

Do you realize that people are still having sex?
They've been told not to, perhaps they are perplexed
When you see them holding hands, they're making future plans
To engage in the activity.
Do you understand me?

People are still having sex
Lust keeps on lurking
Nothing makes them stop
This aids things not working.

People are still having sex
It's been going on for quite awhile
Perhaps it's quite fashionable
It hasn't gone out of style.

It's a fact that people are still having sex
It's rather obvious, it's just what one expects
The evidence is all around
That everyone in every town has had it one time, or another
In their life.

At this very moment people are still having sex
In a downtown condo, or street in the projects
Although you can't see them or hear their breathing sounds
Someone in this world is having sex right now.

People are still having sex!

On the road to nowhere till I found my way back home
You gave me shelter from the cold and the rain - whoa and
Now I know pleasure where there used to be pain

Do I
Do I love you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Do I do I need you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
You saved me with warmth and understanding
You're everything that I could ever want
And after so long we're standing here together
And forever we'll live on
In time most other loves just wither and fade, I tell ya
Ours just gets stronger each and every day
Do I
Do I love you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Do I do I need you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Hey-come over here for a second...
I got something I wanna say...
Even though I may not think to tell you every day...
Ooh - I'm so happy you're still mine!
Oh, you came along with a love so sweet, took me by surprise
Knocked me off my feet
You still send shivers up and down my spine
Oh I gotta be the luckiest man alive

Addicted to the feeling intoxicated by her kiss

Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd so

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Hey sugar momma, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl it's you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil talkin' about butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you miss

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady

Come my lady you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
