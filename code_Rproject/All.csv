Well, life on the farm is kinda laid back
Ain't much an old country boy like me can't hackIt's early to rise, early in the sack
Thank God, I'm a country boy

Well, a simple kinda life never did me no harm
A raisin' me a family and workin' on a farm
My days are all filled with an easy country charm
Thank God, I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God, Im a country boy

When the work's all done, and the sun's settin' low
I pull out my fiddle, and I rosin up the bow
The kids are asleep, so I keep it kinda low
And thank God, I'm a country boy

I'd play ""Sally Goodin"" all day if I could
But the Lord and my wife wouldn't take it very good
So I fiddle when I can, work when I should
And thank God, I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God, I'm a country boy, whoo hoo!

Well, I wouldn't trade my life for diamonds or jewels
I never was one of them money hungry fools
Rather have my fiddle and my farmin' tools
Thank God, I'm a country boy

Yeah, city folk drivin' in a black limousine
A lotta sad people thinkin' that's a-mighty keen
Son, let me tell ya now exactly what I mean
Thank God, I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Thank God, I'm a country boy, yes sir!

Well, my fiddle was my daddy's till the day he died
And he took me by the hand, held me close to his side
Said, ""Live a good life, play the fiddle with pride
And thank God you're a country boy""

Well, my daddy taught me young how to hunt and how to whittle
Taught me how to work and play a tune on the fiddle
Taught me how to love and how to give just a little
And thank God I'm a country boy

Well, I got me a fine wife, I got me old fiddle
When the sun's comin' up, I got cakes on the griddle
Life ain't nothin' but a funny, funny riddle
Whoo! Thank God, I'm a country boy, yeah!

All a lil' thug could do was cry, cry
Why'd they kill my dog?
Damn, man, I miss my Uncle Charles, y'all
And he shouldn't be gone
In front of his home, what they did to Boo was wrong
Oh so wrong, was so wrong
Gotta hold on, gotta stay strong

You see someone you'd just like to mingle
And imagine that she is waiting for you
'S waiting waiting for you
Is waiting for you
Waiting for you

See it's burning me to hold onto this
I know this is something I gotta doBut that don't mean I want to
What I'm trying to say is that I... love you, I just
I feel like this is coming to an end
And its better for me to
Let it go now than hold on and hurt you
I gotta let it burn

It's gonna burn for me to say this
But it's comin' from my heart
It's been a long time coming
But we done been fell apart
Really wanna work this out
But I don't think you're gonna change
I do but you don't think it's best we go our separate ways
Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby
Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with
I think that you should let it burn

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to even though this might bruise you
Let it burn
Let it burn, gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn, gotta let it burn

Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
Got somebody here, but I want you
'Cause the feelin ain't the same
Find myself callin' her your name
Ladies, tell me do you understand?
Now all my fellas, do you feel my pain?
It's the way I feel
I know I made a mistake, now it's too late
I know she ain't comin' back
What I gotta do now to get my shorty back?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh...
Man I don't know what I'm gonna do without my boo
You've been gone for too long
It's been fifty-leven days, umpteen hours
I'ma be burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to, even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn, you gon' learn)
Let it burn, gotta let it burn

Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
Hate the thought of her being with someone else
But you know that it's over, we knew it was through
Let it burn
Let it burn, gotta let it burn

I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me
That I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (Ooh)
I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me
That I need to move on
On the other side I wanna break down and cry (Yeah)

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Can ya feel me burnin'?)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So many days, so many hours
I'm still burnin' 'til you return (Let it burn)

When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't
Jumpin' like it used to even though this might bruise you
Let it burn (Let it burn)
Let it burn, gotta let it burn

I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you goI didn't know nothing I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself

I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
'Cause I didn't know you, 'cause I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt

The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choice
Or what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here
'Cause baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's going to talk to me on
The phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's going to take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night, when you're on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me, ""If you think you're lonely now""
Wait a minute this is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station

So I turn the dial trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
And it's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together but I'm falling apart

I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things crying trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
Pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you need you back in my life baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together

Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who's going to take your place?
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together, baby

When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
'Cause we belong together
Who am I gon' lean on when times get rough?

Who's going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?

"41",41,"1972","Slippin' Into Darkness","War","Now and then I think of when we were together
Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
I told myself that you were right for meBut felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember

You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end
So when we found that we could not make sense
Well, you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad it was over

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothin'
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over
But had me believin' it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way
Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go
And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know

But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know

You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)

This is how we do it, all hands are in the air
And wave them from here to there
If you're an O.G. mack or a wanna be player
You see the hood's been good to me
Ever since I was a lowercase G
But now I'm a big G, the girls see I got the money
A hundred dollar bills y'all
If you were from where I'm from then you would know
That I gotta get mine in a big black truck
You can get yours in a '64
Whatever it is, the party's underway
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up
And let me hear the party say

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
Let's flip the track, bring the old school back (This is how we do it)

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
YNV, SCC (This is how we do it), all my homies
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)

Check it out!
Once upon a time in '94
Montell made no money and life sure was slow
All they said was 6'8"" he stood
And people thought the music that he made was good
There lived a D.J. and Paul was his name
He came up to Monty, this is what he said
You and OG are gonna make some cash
Sell a million records and we'll make in a dash

Ohh, I'm buzzin' because... (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
To all my neighbors you got much flavor (This is how we do it)
I'll never come wack on an old school track (This is how we do it)

I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because (This is how we do it)
South Central does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
Oh, it's party time! (This is how we do it)
Straight up comin' from the Westside (This is how we do it)
O.G.s got the flavor, yeahhhhh (This is how we do it)
And Monty does it like nobody does (This is how we do it)
C'mon now, Def Jam, you know what it is (This is how we do it)"

Cursing at your life
You're a discontented motherAnd a regimented wife
I 've no doubt
You dream about the things you'll never do
But I wish someone had a talk to me like I wanna talk to you

Ooh, I've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could run
Took the hand of a preacher man
And we made love in the sun
But I ran out of places and friendly faces
Because I had to be free

I've been to paradise but I've never been to me...

Please lady please lady
Don't just walk away
'Cause I have this need to tell you
Why I'm all alone today
I can see so much of me
Still living in your eyes

Won't you share a part
Of a weary heart that has lived a million lives

Ooh, I've been to Nice and the Isle of Greece
When I sipped champagne on a yacht
I moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo
And showed them what I've got

I've been undressed by kings
And I've seen some things that a woman ain't s'posed to see
I've been to paradise but I've never been to me...

Hey, you know what paradise is?
It's a lie
A fantasy we created about people and places
As we like them to be
But you know what truth is?

It's that little baby you're holding
And it's that man you fought with this morning
The same one you are gonna make love to tonight
That's truth that's love

Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children
That might have made me complete
But I, I took the sweet life
I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet

I spent my life exploring
The subtle whoring
That costs too much to be free
Hey lady I've been to paradise
But I've never been to me...

I've been to paradise - never been to me
(I've been to Georgia and California, and anywhere I could run)
I've been to paradise - never been to me

While I sipped champagne on a yacht)

You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life

Now, you're the inspiration of this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now, I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait, wait, wait, wait, wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life

Girl, you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do

You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life

You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life
You are, you are the love of my life

Man, I swear I love her, how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be lettin' bands go
Everybody hatin', we just call them fans though
In love with the money, I ain't never lettin' go

It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my homeWe're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good song in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
You gone like the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I should do to you
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good song in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally

Nothing but shattered dreams, shattered dreams
Feel like I could run away, run away

Woke up to reality
And found the future not so bright
I dreamt the impossible
That maybe things could work out right

That promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them

With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me?

Just the two of us, you and I

Wasted water's all that is
And it don't make no flowers grow
Good things might come to those who wait
Not to those who wait too late
We got to go for all we know

Just the two of us, we can make it if we try
Just the two of us (just the two of us)

Building them castles in the sky
Just the two of us, you and I

On the window down the hall
And it becomes the morning dew
And darling, when the morning comes
And I see the morning sun
I want to be the one with you

I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone the devil's best friend

We're living in a bad dream

And you were the one they backed up to the wall

You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago

All those years ago

All those years ago

Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of lies
And all else that we despised

They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago

You said it all though not many had ears

You had control of our smiles and our tears

It wasn't hard to see the truth

When loves begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins
The game nobody wins

They must have loved each other once
Before the magic slipped away
And as their life became a lie
What love remained began to die
I used to hide beneath the sheets
I prayed that time would find a way
But with the passing of the years
I watched as laughter turned to tears

And in the end nobody wins...

We used to love each other once
With all the passion we posessed
But people change as time goes by
Some feelings grow while others die
But if we can learn from what we'll see
And face the truth while we still can
Then, though the passion may be gone
Some kind of love can still live on"

A little is alright
When you say, ""Come over and spend the night
Tonight, tonight.""

When I say, ""I love you,"" you say, ""You better...""
You better you better you bet
When I say, ""I need you,"" you say, ""You better...""
You better you better you bet
You better bet your life
Or love will cut you like a knife

I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying ""you better""
You better bet your life

You better love me all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me all the time now
You better shove me back into line now

I showed up late one night
With a neon light for a visa
But knowing I am so eager to fight
Can't make letting me in any easier

I know I've been wearing crazy clothes
And I look pretty crappy sometimes
But my body feels so good
And I still sing a razor line every time

And when it comes to all-night living
I know what I'm giving
I've got it all down to a tee
And it's free

When I say, ""I love you,"" you say, ""You better...""
You better you better you bet
When I say, ""I need you,"" you say, ""You better...""
You better you better you bet

When I say, ""I love you,"" you say, ""You better...""
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you scream ""You better!""
You better you better you bet

When I say, ""I love you,"" you say, ""You better...""
You better you better you bet
When I say, ""I need you,"" you say, ""You better...""
You better you better you bet

When I say, ""I love you,"" you say, ""You better...""
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you scream ""You better!""
You better you better you bet

You better bet your life
Or love will cut you just like a knife"

I can't believe it myself.
Suddenly I'm up on top of the worldShould have been somebody else.

Believe it or not, I'm walking on air.
I never thought I could feel so free.
Flying away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me.

Looks like the light of a new day
Hit me from out of the blue.
Breaking me out of the spell I was in
Making all of my wishes come true.

Believe it or not, I'm walking on air.
I never thought I could feel so free.
Flying away on a wing and a prayer
Who could it be?
Believe it or not, it's just me.

This is too good to be true,
Look at me
Falling for you.
Believe it or not,
Believe it or not,
Believe it or not,

Now i realize that it's never over only set aside
Oh it's you sweet baby
I will never be free from your embrace

Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you sweet baby
Ever always been captured by your smile, sweet baby
I will always be right there by your side
Right by your side
Lying here alone I'm dreaming
My mind keeps wonderin'
My thoughts are only you
Wanderin' through the mem'ries in my mind
How could love so real have gone so empty?
My mind keeps wonderin' why
Will i ever find the love we shared
Together you and i?
Oh it's you sweet baby
Though we've had such a long hard road to climb, sweet baby
Only hopin' it's not too late to try again
It's you, sweet baby
Won't you try and believe in what i say, sweet baby

You are my fireThe one desire
Believe when I say
I want it that way

But we are two worlds apart
Can't reach to your heart
When you say
That I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Am I your fire?
Your one desire
Yes, I know it's too late
But I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never wanna hear you say
I want it that way

Now I can see that we've fallen apart
From the way that it used to be, yeah
No matter the distance
I want you to know
That deep down inside of me

You are my fire
The one desire
You are (you are, you are, you are)

Don't wanna hear you say
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake (don't wanna hear you say)
I never wanna hear you say (oh, yeah)
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say (never wanna hear you say)
I want it that way

Tell me why
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say (don't want to hear you say)
I want it that way

Only emptiness inside usBaby, look what we've become

We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain

I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be

Though I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry

Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denyin' what we had is gone

Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around

I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be

Though I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, I don't wanna cry, no, no, no

There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make believing, on make believing

Just let the feeling sweep you off your feet

You've got to believe in love
It's a feeling that's next to none
Can't stop until we are one
With the power of love

Tell everyone to try
I promise you'll reach the sky
One thing that you can't deny
Is the power of love

When we walk down the street
We don't care who we see or who we meet
Don't need to run, don't need to hide
'Cause we've got something burning inside, yeah

We've got love power
It's the greatest power of them all, ooh... ooh...
We've got love power
And together we can't fall, sing it with

Wipe away the teardrop from your eye
You're lying safe in bedIt was all a bad dream spinning in your head
Your mind tricked you to feel the pain
Of someone close to you leaving the game of life
So here it is, another chance
Wide awake you face the day
Your dream is over
Or has it just begun?

There's a place I like to hide
A doorway that I run through in the night
Relax child, you were there
But only didn't realize and you were scared
It's a place where you will learn
To face your fears, retrace the years
And ride the whims of your mind
Commanding in another world
Suddenly, you hear and see
This magic new dimension

(I-I-I)
Will be watching over you
(I-I-I)
Am gonna help you see it through
(I-I-I)
Will protect you in the night
(I-I-I)
Am smiling next to you, in Silent Lucidity

(Visualize your dream)
(Record it in the present tense)
(Put it into a permanent form)
(If you persist in your efforts)
(You can achieve dream control, dream control)
(How are we feeling today, better?)
(Dream control, dream control)
(Help me)

If you open your mind for me
You won't rely on open eyes to see
The walls you built within
Come tumbling down, and a new world will begin
Living twice at once you learn
You're safe from the pain in the dream domain
A soul set free to fly
A round trip journey in your head
Master of illusion, can you realize
Your dream's alive, you can be the guide but...

(I-I-I)
Will be watching over you
(I-I-I)
Gonna help you see it through

Will protect you in the night

The flames are gettin' higher in effigy
Burnin' down the bridges of my memory
Love may still be alive somewhere, some way
Where they're downing only deer
A hundred steel towns away

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beatin' like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
Oh, never will I roam
Now I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailin'

Photographs, kerosine
Light my darkness, light it up, light it up
I can still feel the touch
Of your thin blue jeans
Runnin' down the alley
I've got my eyes all over you baby, oh baby

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beatin' like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
Oh, never will I roam
Now I know my place is home
Where the ocean meets the sky
I'll be sailin'

Oh, I've got lightning in my veins
Shiftin' like the handle of a slot machine
Love may still exist in another place
I'm just yankin' back the handle, no expression on my face

Oh, the rhythm of my heart
Is beatin' like a drum
With the words ""I love you""
Rolling off my tongue
Oh, never will I roam

I need a little loving only you know what I mean
Don't misunderstand me, I'm not getting soft
All I want is a couple days off

Yeah, just a couple days
Let me catch my breath

Thank God for the weekend

Ah back to the old grind

I don't need another long coffee break
I've had as much coffee as a man can take
I need to change my disposition change my point of view
I need time to figure out what I wanna do

Believe me when I tell you it gets a little rough

I am Latin, but I ain't wrapping in satin, no!

I'm fresh and new and making my debut

It's our tradition, we're well conditioned
We outlast the competition
So, listen!

We don't care too much about kissing, no!
We know just what you've been missing, hon!
We're straight out and blunt
We don't put up with stunts...
Baby, you know what we want...

No demands and forget holding hands
Please, not around our friends

We intend to hold on to our image
Don't try to cross the line of scrimmage
Don't say you weren't aware
So, have yourself prepared and beware
This is a one-time love affair

See, ""that's as far as it goes"" is our motto
And you thought you won the lotto
Waiting to claim your prize
You go unrecognized
Huh! How's that for a surprise?

So, save yourself from confusion and sorrow
Don't even think about tomorrow
Tonight's the night, enjoy!
We're here to make some noise
Let me hear the high pitch in your voice...

You wake and we're gone
So, you wonder what you did wrong, huh?
Don't be blamin' yourself
It's a must that we vanish
Here's the scoop straight to you but in Spanish...

Oye nena, rubia, morena
Mi excusa está en mis venas
Soy un simple mujeriego, no lo niego ni miento
Soy latino cien por ciento

Así que piénsalo bien
¿Si no es conmigo, con quién es?
Responde de una vez...
No te me hagas la importante, la difícil o atorrante
Al cabo tengo más amantes

No te prometo nada, saldrás por donde entrastes
Yo no pienso molestarte
Así que no me busques, me sigas, me asustes
Busca a otro que te ajuste

Now there it is, laid out plain and simple
In Spanish, but on tempo
Can't comprehend at all, confused or in a hole?
Yo! What's the matter? ¿No habla español?

If that's the case, then, no need to worry
Bust out the dictionary
You want some inside info?
Wanna know what you're in for?
Look up right under ""nympho"" ...

We want the funk (got you babe)
Give up the funk (pow!)
We need the funk (got you babe)
Gotta have that funk (pow!)

And I boarded the plane
Touched down in the land of the Delta BluesIn the middle of the pouring rain
W.C. Handy
Won't you look down over me
Yeah, I got a first class ticket
But I'm as blue as a boy can be

Then I'm walking in Memphis
Was walking with my feet, ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

Saw the ghost of Elvis
On Union Avenue
Followed him up to the gates of Graceland
Then I watched him walk right through
Now security they did not see him
They just hovered 'round his tomb
But there's a pretty little thing, waiting for the king
Down in the Jungle Room

When I was walking in Memphis
I was walking with my feet, ten feet off of Beale
Walking in Memphis
But do I really feel the way I feel

They've got catfish on the table
They've got gospel in the air
And Reverend Green, be glad to see you
When you haven't got a prayer
Boy, you got a prayer in Memphis

Now Muriel, plays piano
Every Friday at the Hollywood
And they brought me down to see her
And they asked me if I would
To do a little number
And I sang with all my might
She said, ""Tell me are you a Christian child?""
And I said, ""Ma'am, I am tonight""

What comes naturally

Nobody's come along that
I would want to call mine

My phone's been ringing but
My heart, it just wont answer
I can't pretend cause
It's love I'm after

I was not prepared for
What I saw in your eyes
I saw something I've been
Waiting for a long time

That you're no stranger
I can tell that
My heart's in danger

There's a time to be free
Let's get together and

I could play hard to get
But what good would that do me
You'd look into my eyes and
You would see right through me

This is a powerful feeling
That we're feeling
I can't deny
It's my heart you're stealing

(I've been looking)
I want to tell you now
That I am not afraid
I'll let the walls come down
Tonight I'm feeling brave

(Let's get together)
The risk is worth
Any chance that I'm taking
This could turn out to be
Love we're making

Set your love free
Falling in love
Should come naturally

Get together and

Get together and
Do what comes naturally

Crazy, crazy, it's getting kind of wild
Is that a yes I'm seeing in your smile
I don't know you, but I feel we're connected
One look from you and baby I'm affected

I can tell that you're reading my thoughts
But let me tell you now I'm not afraid of getting caught
The risk is worth any chance we're takin'
'Cause this could turn out to be love we're makin'

I've been looking for you
You've been looking for me
Let's get together and

And be a rider in a love game
Following the stars
Don't need no book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all

She has a train goin' downtown
She's got a club on the moon
But she's tellin' all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon
She's the heart of the fun fair
She's got me whistlin' her private tune

And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend

She says, ""Hello, you fool, I love you""
C'mon join the joyride, join the joyride

She's a flower, I can paint her
She's a child of the sun
We're a part of this together
Could never turn around and run
Don't need no fortune teller
To know where my lucky love belongs, oh no

'Cos it all begins again when it ends

Do you understand me?

People are still having sex
Lust keeps on lurking
Nothing makes them stop
This aids things not working.

People are still having sex
It's been going on for quite awhile
Perhaps it's quite fashionable
It hasn't gone out of style.

It's a fact that people are still having sex
It's rather obvious, it's just what one expects
The evidence is all around
That everyone in every town has had it one time, or another
In their life.

At this very moment people are still having sex
In a downtown condo, or street in the projects
Although you can't see them or hear their breathing sounds
Someone in this world is having sex right now.

People are still having sex!
People are still having sex!
People are still having sex!
People are still having sex!

People are still having sex
Lust keeps on lurking
Nothing makes them stop
This aids things not working.

People are still having sex
It's been going on for quite awhile
Perhaps it's quite fashionable
It hasn't gone out of style.

People are still having sex!
People are still having sex!
People are still having sex!
People are still having sex!
Sex!"
"1946",46,"1991","Cry For Help","Rick Astley","She's taken my time
Convinced me she's fine
But when she leavesI'm not so sure

It's always the same
She's playing her game
And when she goes
I feel to blame

Why won't she say
She needs me?
I know she's not
As strong as she seems

Why don't I see
Her cry for help?
Why don't I feel
Her cry for help?
Why don't I hear
Her cry for help?

I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all

The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste

Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?

All that I need
Is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me
Cry for help
All I can do
Is cry for help

No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain
Cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Cry for help
Is all I need
All I need
Is a cry for help

Why must we hide emotions?
Why can't we ever break down and cry?

All that I need
Is to cry for help
I will be there
When you cry for help
Why don't I hear
Her cry for help?

All that I need
Is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me
Cry for help
All I can do
Is cry for help

All that I need
Is to cry for help
I will be there
When you cry for help..."
"1947",47,"1991","More Than Ever","Nelson","Do I
Do I love you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeahMore than ever
I remember all I wanted in a lover
Was just a pretty face but all I found were hearts of stone
Spent a lifetime
On the road to nowhere till I found my way back home
You gave me shelter from the cold and the rain - whoa and
Now I know pleasure where there used to be pain

Chorus:
Do I
Do I love you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Do I do I need you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
You saved me with warmth and understanding
You're everything that I could ever want
And after so long we're standing here together
And forever we'll live on
In time most other loves just wither and fade, I tell ya
Ours just gets stronger each and every day
Do I
Do I love you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Do I do I need you baby
YeahYeahYeahYeah
More than ever
Hey-come over here for a second...
I got something I wanna say...
Even though I may not think to tell you every day...
Ooh - I'm so happy you're still mine!
Oh, you came along with a love so sweet, took me by surprise
Knocked me off my feet
You still send shivers up and down my spine
Oh I gotta be the luckiest man alive
Repeat Chorus"
"1948",48,"1991","She Talks To Angels","The Black Crowes","She never mentions the word ""addiction""
In certain company
Yes, she'll tell you she's an orphanAfter you meet her family

She paints her eyes as black as night now
Pulls those shades down tight
Yeah, she gives a smile when the pain come
The pain gonna make everything alright

Says she talks to angels
They call her out by her name
Oh yeah, she talks to angels
Says they call her out by her name

She keeps a lock of hair in her pocket
She wears a cross around her neck
Yes, the hair is from a little boy
And the cross is someone she has not met, not yet

Says she talks to angels
Says they all know her name
Oh yeah, she talks to angels
Says they call her out by her name

She don't know no lover
None that I ever seen
Yeah, to her that ain't nothin'
But to me, it means
Means everything

She paints her eyes as black as night now
She pulls those shades down tight
Oh yeah, there's a smile when the pain comes
The pain gonna make everything alright, alright

She talks to angels
Says they call her out by her name
Oh, yeah, angels
Call her out by her name
Oh, angels
They call her out by her name
Oh, she talks to angels
They call her out, yeah, yeah
Call her out
Don't you know that they
Call her out by her name?"
"1949",49,"1991","P.A.S.S.I.O.N.","Rhythm Syndicate","Sitting in my bedroom the rain is pouring down
The shade is on the window and loneliness is all around
A little voice I'm hearing says don't you stay inside
But I can't fight this feeling got L.U.S.T. on my mind

I head for the arena where lovers try their fate
Moving through the darkness I take my place and wait
A pretty bird beside me says hello with her eyes
She looks so sweet and lovely but is she N.A.S.T.Y?

CHORUS
P.A.S.S.I.O.N.
Got me in a jam again
There's no way that I can win
P.A.S.S.I.O.N.

Her lips are callin to me no way I can resist
Addicted to the feeling intoxicated by her kiss
I take her to my castle we set our bodies free
And while the music played on she loved me down from A to Z

The night is getting longer I start to realise
Don't know what I've got into the girl is C.R.A.Z.Y.
I try to cool the fire like I oughta should
But there's no way to turn back the S.E.X. is just too good

Chorus

Don't be tempted to touch the fire
I shouldve read all the warning signs
You might get burned by your own desire
I lost my mind I must have been blind

I never knew another lover that was evil under cover
Then I discovered you girl, you're like no other
Doin the time for the crime I was blind
To the games that you were playin
Words that you were sayin
Goin out of my mind, you're like a hurricane
Drive me insane you're like a heart attack
Know it's a fact, you got the knack to drop a man to his knees

Chorus"
"1950",50,"1991","The Dream Is Still Alive","Wilson Phillips","Not so long ago we were so in phase
You and I could never forget the days
But then the fire seemed to flickerCold wind came and it carried us away
But we'll get back someday, baby

The dream is still alive
Look here in my eyes
Can you see what I'm feeling?
The dream is still alive
The one of you and I
And my heartache is healing
I couldn't let it die
No I knew it would survive
The dream is still alive

Not so long ago in a purple haze
People dreamed out loud they were not afraid
They stopped the war but not the dying
Some got a little bit lost along the way
But somehow we're here today
And we say

The dream is still alive
After all this time
The flame keeps on burning
The dream is still alive
The one of you and I
And my heart keeps returning
I couldn't let it die
No I knew it would survive
The dream is, the dream is still alive

Oh yeah.

The dream is still alive
Look here in my eyes
Can you see what I'm feeling
The dream is still alive
The one of you and I
And my heartache is healing
I couldn't let it die
For all the times we tried
The dream is still alive"

Touch of her skin feeling silky smooth
Color of cafe au lait alright
Made the savage beast inside roar until he cried,
More-more-more

Now he's back home doin' 9 to 5

Sleepin' the grey flannel life

But when he turns off to sleep memories creep,

To meet someone I think you know
The air was coldSkies were so grey
Somebody lay on the ground below
All For You
All For You
All For You

Came face to face
Felt so uneasy
Oh so confused as what's going on
Just could not move
Feel so affaid
Whisper the words
The words were said

All For You
All For You
All For You

Into the street
People can meet
Don't turn your back to the view
The silver blade can cut up your throat
I tell you now
'Cause I know it's true

All For You

To meet someone

Forgetting all I'm lacking
Completely incomplete
I'll take your invitation
You take all of me now

Letting go of all I've held on to

I'm running and not quite sure where to go
And I don't know what I'm diving into

There's nothing else to find
There's nothing in the world

But as long as you a thicky thicky thick girl you know that it's on
You know that it's on
I peep summin comin towards me on the dance floor
Sexy and real slow (hey) and sayin

Somewhere that we could go
How could I tell her no?
Her measurements were 36-25-34

I like the way you brush it
And I like those stylish clothes you wear
I like the way the light hit the ice and glare
And I can see you movin way over there

Come in and I landed
Nelly Furtado
Come in and I landed

She's a freak and
I'm a chief head banger with
The top down low on the flow
'Cause you're so fresh (fresh) like
B-boys with vests like runners'
Carved chests?
He he he he
I run like the breeze to
Catch this life but sometimes
Get a need till I bleed
There's truth, I go
There's around, I will tell it
A story, on the planet
Missy come in and I landed
Well where did she come from?
This international Goddess sun
So get your hands up
Like this hun
Until the party's just begun
So come over to my house
And that's where
This song's from a less
For the laugh from
West coast version
Portugese diva
And Missy's the woman
Who always be cooking
Says somethin' for Neltado
Who come dip her vibin'
From DC to DJ and
All around the world
Come giddy up
Giddy up back back
Up to my girl

Un get ur freak on (repeat)
Get (Scatted)
Get your freak on

Who's that bitch?
Me me Nelly Nelly
Nelly Furtado
All in your stereo
I'm pumpin' louder
Please don't tell me
You don't like the flow
You got the means
To put down
So lemme step it
Yo

It's a original flow
People better lay low
Stick you up like velcro
'Cause me and Nelly say so
I'm doin' how we do
Some strange loose thing
You crew
Because my fire springs
Your head round right
Missy

Get your freak on
Get (Scatted)
Get your freak on

Ah

Everybody gettin'
Freak-deaky want dance
Grab your partners tightly
By the ___ and want dance
Move your body
Swiftly to the beat
And want dance

Everybody crunk in the club

Everybody hot and on the block
They want dance
Everybody gettin' freak-deaky

I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my windowAnd I can't see at all

And even if I could, it'd all be grey
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again

And even if I'm there, they'll all imply
That I might not last the day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you
Is having the best day of my life

Push the door, I'm home at last
And I'm soaking through and through
And then you handed me a towel
And all I see is you
And even if my house falls down now
I wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me

And I want to thank you
For giving me the best day of my life
Oh, just to be with you

With drops of Jupiter in her hair

Reminds me that there's a time to change

Since the return from her stay on the moon
She listens like spring and she talks like June
He-e-ey
He-e-ey

But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way to see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar and did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?

Now that she's back from that soul vacation
Tracing her way through the constellation

She checks out Mozart while she does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's room to grow
He-e-ey

Now that she's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that she might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who was too afraid to fly so he never did land

But tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find? And then you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there

Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance
Freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had
And me?

Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day
And head back toward the Milky Way?
But tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way? To see the lights all faded
And that Heaven is overrated?
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar, and then you miss me
While you were looking for yourself?

They had the liquor overflowing the cupAbout 5 or 6 strippers trying to work for a buck
And I took one girl outside with me
Her name was Lonni, she went to junior high with me
I said, ""Why you up in there dancing for cash?
I guess a whole a lot's changed since I seen you last.""
She said

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smoking rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

Girl you ain't the only one with a baby
That's no excuse to be living all crazy
Then she looked me right square in the eye
And said every day I wake up hoping to die
She said-nigga I know about pain cause
Me and my sister ran away so my daddy couldn't rape us
Before I was a teenager
I been through more shit that you can't even relate to

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smoking rock now, in and out of lockdown
I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time, but for me this is what I call life

Hold up!
What would you do?
Get up on my feet and let go of every excuse
What would you do?
Cause I wouldn't want my baby to go through what I went through
Come on, what would you do?
Get up on my feet and stop making tired excuses
What would you do?
Girl, I know if my mother can do it, baby you can do it

What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to, sleep with a man for a little bit of money

I don't know why they say grown men don't cry

I'm 10 years old, and he's holding my hand
We're talkin' on the front porch watchin' the sun go down
But it was just a dream he was a slave to his job and he couldn't be around
So many things I wanna say to him
But I just placed a rose on his grave, and I talk to the wind

But I don't know why they say grown men don't cry
I don't know why they say grown men don't cry, don't cry

I'm sittin' here with my kids and my wife
And everything that I hold dear in my life
We say grace and thank the lord
Got so much to be thankful for
Then it's up the stairs and off to bed and my little girl says
I haven't had my story yet.

And everything weighin' on my mind disappears just like that
When she lifts her head off her pillow and says,

Hair that twirls on finger tips
So gently, baby
Hands that rest on jutting hips
Repenting

Hurt that's not supposed to show
And tears that fall when no one knows
When you're trying hard to be your best
Could you be a little less...?

"2940",40,"2001","It's A Great Day To Be Alive","Travis Tritt","I got rice cooking in the microwave
Got a three day beard I don't plan to shave
And it's a goofy thing but I just gotta sayHey I'm doing alright

Yeah I think I'll make me some homemade soup
Feelin' pretty good and that's the truth
It's neither drink nor drug induced
No I'm just doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?

Oh, yeah

It's been fifteen years since I left home
Said good luck to every seed I'd sown
Give it my best and then I left it alone
Oh, I hope they're doin' alright

Now I look in the mirror and what do I see?
A lone wolf there starin' back at me
Long in the tooth but harmless as can be
Lord I guess he's doin' alright

And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?

Sometimes it's lonely
Sometimes it's only me
And the shadows that fill this room

Sometimes I'm fallin'
Desperately callin'
Howlin' at the moon

Well I might go get me a new tattoo
Or take my old Harley for a three day cruise
Might even grow me a fu man chu
And it's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?
It's a great day to be alive
I know the sun's still shinin' when I close my eyes
There's some hard times in the neighborhood
But why can't every day be just this good?

Since I could hold my head up high
And it's been awhileSince I first saw you
And it's been awhile
Since I could stand on my own two feet again

Since I could call you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that are rendered
I've stretched myself beyond my means

And it's been awhile
Since I can say that I wasn't addicted and
It's been awhile
Since I can say I love myself as well and
It's been awhile
Since I've gone and fucked things up just like I always do
And it's been awhile
But all that shit seems to disappear when I'm with you

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem
The consequences that I've rendered
I've gone and fucked things up again, again

Why must I feel this way?
Just make this go away
Just one more peaceful day

And it's been awhile
Since I could
Look at myself straight
And it's been awhile
Since I said I'm sorry
And it's been awhile
Since I've seen them way them candles light your face
And it's been awhile
But I can still remember just the way you taste

And everything I can't remember
As fucked up as it all may seem to be, I know it's me
I cannot blame this on my father
He did the best he could for me

Come come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar babyCome my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby

Such a sexy, sexy pretty little thing
Fierce nipple pierce you got me sprung with your tongue ring
And I ain't gonna lie 'cause your loving gets me high
So to keep you by my side, there's nothing that I won't try
Butterflies in her eyes and looks to kill
Time is passing I'm asking could this be real
'Cause I can't sleep I can't hold still
The only thing I really know is she got sex appeal
I can feel too much is never enough
You're always there to lift me up
When these times get rough
I was lost, now I'm found
Ever since you've been around
You're the women that I want
So yo, I'm putting it down

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

I don't deserve you
Unless it's some kind of hidden message
To show me life is precious
Then I guess it's true
But to tell truth, I really never knew 'til I met you
See I was lost and confused
Twisted and used up
Knew a better life existed but thought that I missed it
My lifestyle's wild I was living like a wild child
Trapped on a short leash paroled the police files
So yo, what's happening now?
I see the sun breaking down into dark clouds
And a vision of you standing out in a crowd so

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady you're my pretty baby
I'll make your legs shake
You make me go crazy

Hey sugar momma, come and dance with me
The smartest thing you ever did was take a chance with me
Whatever tickles your fancy
Girl it's you like Sid and Nancy
So sexy, almost evil talkin' about butterflies in my head
I used to think that happy endings were only in the books I read
But you made me feel alive when I was almost dead
You filled that empty space with the love I used to chase
And as far as I can see it don't get better than this
So butterfly, here is a song and it's sealed with a kiss
And a thank you miss

Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
Come and dance with me
So come and dance with me

Come my lady
Come come my lady
You're my butterfly, sugar baby
Come my lady you're my pretty baby

Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
Finally, I can see you crystal clearGo ahead and sell me out and I′ll lay your ship bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do
There′s a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it′s bring me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could have had it all
(You′re gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I′ve heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won′t be shared

(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love remind me of us
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
I can′t help feeling

We could have had it all
(You′re gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

Could have had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hands
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings to find what you look for
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
You′ll pay me back in kind and reap just what you've sown

(You′re gonna wish you never had met me)
We could have had it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
It all, it all, it all
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You′re gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
And you played it to the beat
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

We could have had it all
(You're gonna wish you never had met me)
Rolling in the deep
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
You had my heart inside of your hands
(You′re gonna wish you never had met me)

But you played it
You played it
You played it
You played it to the beat"

Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo, tell us right

Tonight, I want all of you tonight

Cause tomorrow I'm off to Dubai to perform for a princess
But tonight, I can make you my queen
And make love to you endless
This is insane: the way the name growin'
Money keep flowin' hustlers move aside
So, I'm tiptoein', to keep flowin'
I got it locked up like Lindsay Lohan
Put it on my life, baby
I'll make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow, but I promise tonight (dale)

At least you'll fall on top of the world
Think about it, cause if you slip, I'm gon' fall on top your girl
What I'm involved with is deeper than the
Masons, baby, baby, and it ain't no secret

But I'm an American Idol getting money like Seacrest
Put it on my life, baby,
I make you feel right, baby
Can't promise tomorrow, but I promise tonight (dale)

Could you be the devil?
Could you be an angel?
Your touch, magnetizing
Feels like I am floating
Leaves my body glowing

They say, be afraid
You're not like the others
Futuristic lover
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

You're so supersonic
Wanna feel your powers
Stun me with your laser
Your kiss is cosmic
Every move is magic

You're from a whole 'nother world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go
Lead me into the light

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction

Boy, you're an alien
Your touch, so foreign
It's supernatural
Extraterrestrial

This is transcendental
On another level
Boy, you're my lucky star
I wanna walk on your wavelength
And be there when you vibrate
For you, I'll risk it all, all

Kiss me, ki-ki-kiss me
Infect me with your lovin'
Fill me with your poison
Take me, ta-ta-take me

I want to be just like that

When I love I give it all I've got

When I feel weak and unpretty
I know I'm beautiful and strong
Because I see myself
Like my mother does

I've never met a stranger, I can talk to anyone
Like my mother does
I let my temper fly, but she can walk away
When she's had enough

She sees everybody
For who they really are
I'm so thankful for her guidance
She's helped me get this far

I'm the reporter, baby, you could be the news
'Cause you're the cigarette and I'm the smoker
We raise the bet 'cause you're a joker
Checked off, you are the chalk
And I could be the blackboard
You can be the talk and I can be the walk

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing

You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that
You could bet that, never gotta sweat that

You could be the lover, I'll be the fighter, babe
If I'm the blunt, you could be the lighter, babe
Fire it up
Writer, baby, you could be the quote
If I'm the lyric, baby, you could be the note
Record that

Saint, I'm a sinner
Prize, I'm a winner and it's you
What did I do to deserve that?
Paper, baby, I'll be the pen
Said I'm the one, 'cause you are ten
Real and not pretend

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing

Now rock with me, babe
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, babe, yeah
Now rock with me, babe
Let me hold you in my arms, talk with me, babe, yeah

This love, between you and I, as simple as pie, baby
It's such a sure thing, it's such a sure thing
Oh, is it a sure thing? Yeah-yeah

Even when the sky comes falling
Even when the sun don't shine
I got faith in you and I
So put your pretty little hand in mine
Even when we're down to the wire, babe
Even when it's do or die
We can do it, baby, simple and plain
'Cause this love is a sure thing

Love you like a brother
Treat you like a friend
Respect you like a lover
Oh-woah, oh-woah, oh-woah"

Woah, now!
You know you′ve got everybody lookin'
Got a little boom in my big truck
Gonna open up the doors and turn it up
Gonna stomp my boots in the Georgia mud
Gonna watch you make me fall in love

Get up on the hood of my daddy′s tractor
Up on the toolbox, it don't matter
Down on the tailgate, girl I can't wait
To watch you do your thing

Shake it for the young bucks sittin′ in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin′ 'til the break of dawn
The DJ spinnin′ that country song
C'mon, c′mon, c'mon

Shake it for the birds, shake it for the bees
Shake it for the catfish swimmin′ down deep in the creek
For the crickets and the critters and the squirrels
Shake it to the moon, shake it for me girl, oh

Country girl, shake it for me, girl
Shake it for me girl
Shake it for me

Country girl, shake it for me, girl
Shake it for me, girl
Shake it for me

Sombody's sweet little farmer's child
With a gattle in her Bud to get a little wild
Pony-tail and a pretty smile
Rope me in from a country mile

So come on over here and get in my arms
Spin me around this big ole barn
Tangle me up like grandma′s yarn
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Shake it for the young bucks sittin′ in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin' ′til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin' that country song

Now dance, like a dandelion
In the wind on the hill underneath the pines
Yeah, move like the river flows
Feel the kick drum down deep in your toes
All I wanna do is get to holdin' you and get to knowin′ you
And get to showin′ you and get to lovin' you
′Fore the night is through, baby you know what to do

Shake it for the young bucks sittin' in the honky-tonks
For the rednecks rockin′ 'til the break of dawn
For the DJ spinnin′ that country song

"4403",3,"2016","Can't Stop The Feeling!","Justin Timberlake","I got this feeling inside my bones
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my homeWe're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone

I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good song in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
You gone like the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I should do to you
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance, come on

Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone

Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good song in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop

Under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I should do to you
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So just dance, dance, dance
I can't stop the feeling
So keep dancing, come on

I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the, I can't stop the
I can't stop the feeling

Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling)
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
(I can't stop the feeling)
All those things I should do to you
But you dance, dance, dance
(I can't stop the feeling)
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

Everybody sing
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Wanna see you move your body
(I can't stop the feeling)
Got this feeling in my body
Break it down
Got this feeling in my body
Can't stop the feeling
Got this feeling in my body, come on"

"4406",6,"2016","7 Years","Lukas Graham","Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old
It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger
Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker
By 11 smoking herb and drinking burning liquor
Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure

Once I was 11 years old, my daddy told me
Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely
Once I was 11 years old

I always had that dream like my daddy before me
So I started writing songs, I started writing stories
Something about the glory, just always seemed to bore me
'Cause only those I really love will ever really know me

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
Before the morning sun, when life was lonely
Once I was 20 years old
(Lukas Graham)

I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure
'Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major
I got my boys with me atleast those in favor
And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later

Once I was 20 years old, my story got told
I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me
Once I was 20 years old

Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold
We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming
Soon we'll be 30 years old

I'm still learning about life
My woman brought children for me
So I can sing them all my songs
And I can tell them stories
Most of my boys are with me
Some are still out seeking glory
And some I had to leave behind
My brother I'm still sorry

Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61
Remember life and then your life becomes a better one
I made the man so happy when I wrote a letter once
I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold
Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me
Soon I'll be 60 years old

Once I was seven years old, my mama told me
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely
Once I was seven years old

Once I was seven years old"
"4407",7,"2016","I Took A Pill In Ibiza","Mike Posner","I took a pill in Ibiza
To show Avicii I was cool
And when I finally got sober, felt ten years olderBut fuck it, it was something to do

I'm living out in L.A.
I drive a sports car just to prove
I'm a real big baller 'cause I made a million dollars
And I spend it on girls and shoes

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone

You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs

I'm just a singer who already blew his shot
I get along with old timers
'Cause my name's a reminder of a pop song people forgot

And I can't keep a girl, no
'Cause as soon as the sun comes up
I cut 'em all loose, and work's my excuse
But the truth is I can't open up

But you don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone

You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all I know are sad songs, sad songs (hey)

I took a plane to my hometown
I brought my pride and my guitar
All my friends are all gone, but there's manicured lawns
And the people still think I'm a star

I walked around downtown
I met some fans on Lafayette
They said, ""Tell us how to make it 'cause we're getting real impatient""
So I looked 'em in the eye and said

You don't wanna be high like me
Never really knowing why like me
You don't ever wanna step off that roller coaster and be all alone

You don't wanna ride the bus like this
Never knowing who to trust like this
You don't wanna be stuck up on that stage singing
Stuck up on that stage singing
All that I know are sad songs, sad songs
Darling, all that I know are sad songs, sad songs"

Made my decision to test my limits
Cause it's my business, God as my witnessStart what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open

All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout

Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, cause I'm a taker
Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger

All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God

I was good on my own, that's the way it was, that's the way it wasYou was good on the low for a faded fuck, on some faded love
Shit, what the fuck you complaining for?
Feeling jaded huh?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to you
Had some fun on the run though I give it to you

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch
Didn't they tell you that I was a savage
Fuck your white horse and a carriage
Bet you never could imagine
Never told you you could have it

You needed me
Oooh, you needed me
To feel a little more, and give a little less
Know you hate to confess
But baby ooo, you needed me

You been rollin' around, shit I'm rollin up
Light and roll it up
Break it down like a pound, shit was never us
Shit was never us
That's the real on the real, are you serious?
How you feel, how you feel?
Used to trip off that shit I was kickin' to ya
Had some fun on the run though, I give it to ya

But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list
Tryna fix your inner issues with a bad bitch

Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

You found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
And all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back

Before you found someone more exciting
The next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough

Don't you think I loved you too much to be used and discarded?
Don't you think I loved you too much to think I deserve nothing?
But don't tell me you're sorry, boy
Feel sorry for yourself
'Cause someday I'll be everything to somebody else
And they'll think that I am so exciting
And you'll be the one who's crying

Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied
But I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied
But that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough
For you, enough for you, oh-oh

But the ground

This ain't for everybody
Toes hanging off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a hell of a view

I paint with my old Gibson
You paint your purple sky
This town's our canvas, baby
Let's paint it red tonight
Go out like shooting stars
Chasing what's in our hearts
Into the blue (into the blue)

This ain't for everybody
Toes hanging off the ledge
Like we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a hell of a view
Hell of a view

We ain't for everybody
Toes hanging off a ledge
Like we got nothin', we got nothin' to lose
Ain't always heaven, baby
This livin' on the edge
You holdin' me holdin' you
It's a hell of a view
Hell of a view

Hell of a view
Hell of a view"

He's a bible by the bed
He's the t-shirt that I'm wearingHe's a song stuck in my head
He's solid and he's steady like the Allegheny runs
He knows just where he's going
And he's proud of where he's from

One of the good ones
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one
Like he wrote the book one
The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine
He's one of the good ones

You'll know him when you see him
By the way he looks at me
You'd say he hung the moon
I'd say he hung the galaxy
Nobody does it better
Oh the way he pulls me in
I've known a couple bad ones
But they all led me to him
He's one of the good ones

A love me like he should one

The kind you find when you don't even look one
Anybody can be good once
But he's good all the time
He's one of the good ones
And he's all mine

We should all find us one
They're out there, minus one

Yeah, I got a good one

A love me like he should one

Bartender looks at me like""Pony up, man, we're closin' down""
I paid the tab, and I turned around
Got on that phone on the way home
And ended up down the rabbit hole again

It's funny how you haven't changed a bit
But you're twice as pretty
Glad you finally got to see New York City
And I know it's not a race
But it looks like you're gettin' over me
Faster than I'm gettin' over you
But hey, what you gon' do?

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Back then, I could've convinced myself
That maybe you called when I was out
But you didn't know what to say, so you didn't leave a message
And that you're probably at home right now, sound asleep
'Cause goin' out isn't really your thing
And I wouldn't have a clue what you been up to lately
Or who you been up to it with
But when I don't miss your calls, I miss you callin'
And I go 'round and 'round again

I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
Try to let you go, somethin' always reminds me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
Girl, you're everywhere, everywhere but behind me
I bet breakin' up was easy in the '90s

Modern love, it's the modern hearts breakin'
I'm just a product of my generation, and I
'Bout had enough, watchin' you gettin' on with your life

Baby, I'm sick of sittin' at the house, dyin' on my phone
Wishin' I was somewhere I can be alone
I try to let you go, and somethin' always reminds me

I'm tired of gettin' drunk, tired of bein' free
Tired of seein' pictures I don't wanna see
